We're the **Open Source Community**, a student community established to promote, support, and develop on Open Source Technologies.
Here at VIT-AP, we're the ones that talk about FOSS, and we're the ones that make it happen.

Our community work on projects throughout the course of the year and open sources them to the world.
Check out some of our projects down below!
